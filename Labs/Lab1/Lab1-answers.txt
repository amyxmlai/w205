1. The difference between an Elastic Block Store (EBS) and a Storage Service (S3) has to do with their data storage structure. Often used with an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), an EBS is an instance-independent (virtual) hard drive that separates the instance from the data. This is a very useful (and safe) feature because it helps preserve the data even if an instance were to fail. On the other hand, a S3 is an instance-dependent storage system that is used to readily store and retrieve data. Because a S3 is an instance storage, data may be lost if an instance were to fail. 

2. Cloud infrastructure should be considered for data science tasks when access to and use of many or large servers is required. Because identifying, purchasing, and configuring appropriate servers can be very expensive and time consuming, a cloud infrastructure allows users to obtain (virtual) servers quickly and efficiently at a reasonable price. This greatly streamlines data science tasks and allows businesses and organizations to operate with more efficiency. 

3. The difference between spot instances and reserved instances has to do with their pricing systems and workload duration. Spot instances and reserved instances are different types of EC2 instances that seek to provide compute capacity in a cost-effective way. For spot instances, users “bid” for a spot instance (they set the price they are willing to pay), and “win” the instance when the bid price exceeds the instance price. However, because the spot instance prices can change across time due to supply and demand, a spot instance performance is interrupted when the bid price no longer exceeds the instance price. Spot instances may thus be more appropriate for shorter-term workloads that can tolerate interruptions. 

In contrast, reserved instances are not marked by time-dependent price fluctuations and are not subject to performance interruptions. For reserved instances, users can purchase a reserved instance at a fixed price that is determined by instance attribute, term commitment, and payment option. A reserved instance is purchased for 1 or 3 years and allows users to specify and adjust capacity reservations during that time. For example, when workload requirements change, a reserved instance provides users with the flexibility (without additional charge) to modify various features of their capacity reservations. Thus, unlike spot instances, reserved instances may be more appropriate for longer-term workloads whose capacity requirements may be more predictable.
